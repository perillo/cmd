# cmd [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/perillo/cmd?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/perillo/cmd)

The `cmd` module provides simple support from a single command to have many
subcommands.

## Requirements

`cmd` requires at least *Go* 1.9.  There are no external dependencies.


## Credits

The implementation is based on the one used in the `go` tool, adapted from
`src/cmd/go/internal/base/base.go` and `src/cmd/go/main.go` in the *Go* source
distribution.
